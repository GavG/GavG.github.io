      p GavG is the web and mobile app world presence of me - Gavin Gration. I'm a software developer and computer scientist, born and bred in Manchester UK. This site is a little window for the world to see what sort of stuff I get up to in my spare time.
      p I've always got a handful of personal projects on the go which are usually new and interesting (to me at least). Sometimes the fruits of my labours can be a bit naff but every now and then I come across something unique and or novel that I'd think deserves sharing with the world. In my day-to-day life I write code for a small software development company in the North West of England, when I'm not earning a crust, I like to relax by exploring tech in my own incautious and avid fashion.

        | - I've only just started building this little site so there's not much on it yet, but it'll get there so check back soon! Also, for anyone who was familiar with my wordpress blog and is wondering why it seems that I've abandoned it, it's because I have, it was lacking the flexibility that I need in order to show off my work and to custimise my site how I want :)
