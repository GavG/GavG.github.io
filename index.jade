      p GavG is the web and mobile app world presence of me - Gavin Gration. I'm a software developer and computer scientist from Manchester UK. This site is a little window for the world to see what sort of stuff I get up to in my spare time.
      p I've always got a handful of personal projects on the go which are usually new and interesting (to me at least). Sometimes the fruits of my labours can be a bit naff but every now and then I come across something unique and or novel that I'd think deserves sharing with the world. In my day-to-day life I write code for a small software development company in the North West of England, when I'm not earning a crust, I like to relax by exploring tech in my own incautious and avid fashion.
