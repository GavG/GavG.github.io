        p Ever needed a random timer for a game or some other application? Here you go!
        div.centered.container-row.margin-bottom
            a.btn(href=baseURL+"/misc/randomtimer/index.html", style="background-color:#5C5", target="_blank") OPEN

        p #[strong TO USE:] Just set a minimum and a maximum time, either by clicking on the handy presets or typing in the number of minutes and seconds and Hit 'GO!'. A random timer will be started and will go off at some point between your chosen times.
        p If you get bored or change your mind part way through a time you can simply press 'STOP!' to cancel it and start over.
        p If you plan to use the timer often it helpfully remembers your last settings so you don't have to reenter them when you return!
