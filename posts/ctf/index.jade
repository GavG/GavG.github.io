    h3.w3-border-bottom.w3-border-light-grey.w3-padding-16 CTF Puzzle!

    p Recently I've been playing Capture The Flag (CTF) style puzzles. These involve using technical knowledge to derive a hidden message. This can include breaking encryptions, exploiting program / file type flaws, reverse engineering and general intuitive problem solving. Google has a great #[a(href="https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/", target="_blank") website] that offers these puzzles as educational exercises at beginner and competition levels.
    p Here's my go at crafting one of these puzzles: #[a(href=baseURL+"/misc/CTF/index.html") CTF], think you can decrypt the message? - The puzzle has perfect information, good luck!
